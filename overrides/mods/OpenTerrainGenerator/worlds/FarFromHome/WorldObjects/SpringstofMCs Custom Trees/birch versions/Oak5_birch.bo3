# Branches are objects that will spawn when this object spawns when it is used in
# the CustomStructure resource. Branches can also have branches, making complex
# structures possible. See the wiki for more details.

# Regular Branches spawn each branch with an independent chance of spawning.
# Branch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][IndividualChance])
# branchName - name of the object to spawn.
# rotation - NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
# IndividualChance - The chance each branch has to spawn, assumed to be 100 when left blank

# Weighted Branches spawn branches with a dependent chance of spawning.
# WeightedBranch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][MaxChanceOutOf])
# MaxChanceOutOf - The chance all branches have to spawn out of, assumed to be 100 when left blank
